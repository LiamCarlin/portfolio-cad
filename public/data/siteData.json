      "description": "An autonomous suction-based robot that creates artwork on vertical glass surfaces. Scribblz uses vacuum suction cups to adhere to windows while a precision pen mechanism draws user-uploaded images.",
      "challenge": "Design a robot capable of reliably adhering to smooth vertical surfaces while maintaining precise 2D motion control for drawing. The system needed to handle varying glass conditions, support continuous drawing without losing suction, and convert digital images into smooth pen strokes.",
      "solution": "Developed a dual-suction system with redundant vacuum pumps ensuring continuous adhesion. Implemented a CoreXY-style motion system for the pen mechanism, achieving ±0.5mm positioning accuracy. Created custom G-code generation software that converts images to optimized drawing paths with adjustable detail levels.",
      "impact": "Successfully demonstrated autonomous window art creation at Olin College expo. The robot drew a 12\"x12\" portrait in under 45 minutes. Open-sourced the image-to-path conversion algorithm, which has been adopted by 3 other maker projects.",

Unlike traditional cartesian systems, CoreXY keeps both motors stationary on the frame, reducing moving mass and enabling faster acceleration without sacrificing precision."
